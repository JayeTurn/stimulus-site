# Values

You can read and write [HTML data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*) as typed _values_ using special controller properties.

## Definitions

Define values in a controller using the `static values` object. Put each value's _name_ on the left and its _type_ on the right.

## Types

A value's type is one of `Array`, `Boolean`, `Number`, `Object`, or `String`. The type determines how the value is transcoded between JavaScript and HTML.

Type | Encoded asâ€¦
---- | -----------
Array | `JSON.stringify(array)`
Boolean | `boolean.toString()`
Number | `number.toString()`
Object | `JSON.stringify(object)`
String | Itself

## Properties and Attributes

Stimulus automatically generates getter, setter, and existential properties for each value defined in a controller. These properties are linked to data attributes on the controller's element:

Kind | Property name | Effect
---- | ------------- | ------
Getter | `this.[name]Value` | Reads `data-[identifier]-[name]-value`
Setter | `this.[name]Value=` | Writes `data-[identifier]-[name]-value`
Existential | `this.has[Name]Value` | Tests for `data-[identifier]-[name]-value`

### Getters

The getter for a value decodes the associated data attribute into an instance of the value's type.

If the data attribute is missing from the controller's element, the getter returns a _default value_, depending on the value's type:

Type | Default value
---- | -------------
Array | `[]`
Boolean | `false`
Number | `0`
Object | `{}`
String | `""`

### Setters

The setter for a value sets the associated data attribute on the controller's element.

To remove the data attribute from the controller's element, assign `undefined` to the value.

### Existential Properties

The existential property for a value evaluates to `true` when the associated data attribute is present on the controller's element and `false` when it is absent.

## Change Callbacks

Value _change callbacks_ let you respond whenever a value's data attribute changes.

Define a method `[name]ValueChanged` in the controller, where `[name]` is the name of the value you want to observe for changes. The method receives its decoded value as the first argument.

Stimulus invokes each change callback after the controller is initialized and again any time its associated data attribute changes. This includes changes as a result of assignment to the value's setter.

## Naming Conventions

Write value names as camelCase in JavaScript and kebab-case in HTML. For example, a value named `fileType` in the `reference` controller will have the associated data attribute `data-reference-file-type-value`.
