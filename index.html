title: A modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have.

<hr>

<p>Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn't seek to take over your entire front-endâ€”in fact, it's not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it's designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. Stimulus pairs beautifully with <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal amount of effort.</p>

<p>How does it work? Sprinkle your HTML with magic controller, target, and action attributes:</p>

<pre class="example language-markup"><code><!--<div data-controller="hello">
  <input data-target="hello.name" type="text">
  <button data-action="click->hello#greet">Greet</button>
</div>--></code></pre>

<p>Then write a compatible controller. Stimulus brings it to life automatically:</p>


<pre class="example language-javascript">
<code>// hello_controller.js
import { Controller } from "stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`)
  }

  get name() {
    return this.targets.find("name").value
  }
}</code>
</pre>

<p>Stimulus continuously watches the page, kicking in as soon as magic attributes appear or disappear. It works with any update to the DOM, regardless of whether it comes from a full page load, a Turbolinks page change, or an Ajax request. Stimulus manages the whole lifecycle.</p>

<p>You can write your first controller in five minutes by following along in The <a href="#handbook">Stimulus Handbook</a>.</p>

<h2>Installing Stimulus</h2>

<p>Stimulus integrates with the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> asset packager to automatically load controller files from a folder in your app.</p>

<p>You can use Stimulus with other asset packaging systems, too. And if you prefer no build step at all, just drop a <code class="language-markup">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag on the page and get right down to business.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#">Installation Guide</a> for detailed instructions.</p>
